## Technologies Used
- Next.js App Router for routing and page structure
- React Hooks for state management (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- Typescript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide React for icons
- Custom UI components from our component library

## Mock Data Implementation
Since this is a frontend-focused implementation, mock data was used to simulate API responses. In a production environment, these would be replaced with actual API calls to a backend service. Mock data includes:

- Listing data with properties like title, description, price, etc.
- Platform connection data with statuses and statistics
- User profile information
- Synchronization status information

## Responsive Design
All pages are built with responsive design in mind:
- Mobile-first approach
- Grid and flex layouts that adapt to screen size
- Appropriate spacing and typography for different viewports
- Tables that gracefully handle smaller screens

## Next Steps
Future enhancements could include:
1. Backend integration to replace mock data
2. Real-time updates for sync status
3. WebSocket implementation for notifications
4. Analytics dashboard for listing performance
5. Bulk operations for listings (delete multiple, sync multiple)
6. Advanced filtering and search capabilities

## Conclusion
Step 6 successfully delivered a comprehensive listing management system that allows users to manage their listings across multiple platforms. The UI is intuitive, responsive, and provides all the necessary functionality for users to efficiently manage their online marketplace listings from a single interface.
